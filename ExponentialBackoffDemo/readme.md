I have created a demo on the implementation of Exponential Backoff
For I designed two APIs 
- calculateMystery: This REST API basically generates a random number, this will act as out 
  third party API
- checkMystery : This is where magic happens, It will call the above API and check if 
  the number generated by above API is divisible by 5 if yes task is completed; otherwis it will keep 
  calling the calculateMystery API after(1,2,4,8,16...seconds) until it gets a number which is divisible by 5
- Celery: Initially whenever I called checkMystery API the request was waiting for response until a valid response is received from calcMystery
  So here I implemented asynchronous execution of the task "exp_backoff_task"
- Whenever I call the API checkMystery the task is passed to Celery worker,and we immediate send a response to the client that the request is being processed
  in this case we could let the client know the response of the same.
